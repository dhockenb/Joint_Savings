#JointSavings
##Challenge_20

##Technologies
This smart contract is written using Solidity 0.5.0 using ether management functions to implement joint savings account withdrawals and deposits.  Two user addresses are accepted, and if and require statements are utilized to verify recipient address and account balance.  The smart contract is compiled and deployed in the JavaScript VM. Functionality is tested with screen shots saved in the Execution_Results folder. 

## Usage
Run the joint_savings.sol file in the Remix IDE Solidity environment (remix.ethereum.org).
